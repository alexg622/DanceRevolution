# DanceRevolution

# Background and Overview

DanceRevolution is made purely from Javascript, CSS3, and HTML5. This app has the functionality of generating random arrows for each game so that no two games are ever the same. I also came up with an algorithm to keep beats per minute since setInterval would not keep accurate time. The user can choose between two difficulty settings, normal, and expert. To play the game, click on a difficulty setting and catch the falling arrows using the arrows on your keypad.

#Home Page

At the homepage the user can choose a difficulty to play the game on. There are also links to my github and linkedin profiles. The user can also start the game by pressing the green play button to start the music. Pressing the button again will pause the music.

#Game

Once the game starts the user has to catch the falling arrows in sync with the music using the arrows on the keypad. Once the game is over the user can refresh the page to play again.

#Challenges

Some challenges in creating this game were devising an algorithm to keep track of the beats in the song since setInterval would not keep accurate time. I also created a function to generated random arrows at specific time signatures to make each play different and unique.
